    "Quicksort is, like Mergesort, a divide-and-conquer algorithm but has the added benefit of being in-place (that said, space isn't worth much these days) but, anecdotally, faster than Mergesort by a non-insignificant amount (usually). Whereas Mergesort is guaranteed an *nlog(n)* runtime – where *n* is the size of the input data – Quicksort can vary between *nlog(n)* (although anecdotally faster than Mergesort) and *n^2* in a worst-case scenario.\n",
    "\n",
    "So how's Quicksort like? Quicksort, for starters, is tricky because we'll need to define three different functions that make up the entirety of Quicksort — a general wrapper, a splitter, and a partition-solver. Under the hood, Quicksort uses the idea of a **pivot**, which will be a sort of \"filter\" for our values. The pivot's purpose is to split the list into recursive-subproblems once it has reached its position within the final, sorted array (also called the **split position**).\n",
