    "\n",
    "## Quicksort\n",
    "Quicksort is, like Mergesort, a divide-and-conquer algorithm but has the added benefit of being in-place (that said, space isn't worth much these days) but, anecdotally, faster than Mergesort by a non-insignificant amount (usually). Whereas Mergesort is guaranteed an *nlog(n)* runtime – where *n* is the size of the input data – Quicksort can vary between *nlog(n)* (although anecdotally faster than Mergesort) and *n^2* in a worst-case scenario.\n",
    "\n",
    "So how's Quicksort like? Quicksort, for starters, is tricky because we'll need to define three different functions that make up the entirety of Quicksort — a general wrapper, a splitter, and a partition-solver. Under the hood, Quicksort uses the idea of a **pivot**, which will be a sort of \"filter\" for our values. The pivot's purpose is to split the list into recursive-subproblems once it has reached its position within the final, sorted array (also called the **split position**).\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many different ways to pick a pivot, but let's go with something easy: the first value in the collection.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's extremely important to know how the partition phase works. Let's say we have the array:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"qs_1.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, **```54```** is our pivot value.\n",
    "\n",
    "So partitioning works by having two pointers – ```left_pointer``` and ```right_pointer``` – located at the beginning and end of the remaining, available array (i.e. excluding the pivot location). The purpose of the partition phase is to **move items that are on the _wrong_ side of the pivot onto the right side**. What do we mean by \"wrong\" and \"right\" sides? Well, we essentially want all values within the remaining array that are **less** than our pivot value to be to the left of .\n",
    "\n",
    "To do this, we essentially move our left and right pointers such that they'll converge in the middle after some evaluations. Our ```left_pointer``` will be incremented **until we locate a value that is GREATER THAN the pivot value**. We then decrement our ```right_pointer``` **until we locate a value that is LESS THAN the pivot value**. When we have both, we have found two values that are on the \"wrong\" side and we swap them. We repeat this process of shifting our pointers and swapping values while our pointers haven't crossed – i.e. our ```right_pointer``` is still to the right of our ```left_pointer``` and vice-versa.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once our pointers have crossed, we stop and their position is our **split point**. We swap the pivot position with our split point, and now we know that our pivot value is in it's final, sorted position. Furthermore, everything to the left of our split point is less than our pivot value, and everything to its right is greater than our pivot value. We recursively call quicksort on each half and continue.\n",
    "\n",
    "The entire process looks a bit like so:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"qs_2.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "And the recursive partitioning looks like so:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"qs_3.png\">\n",

    "## Jupyter Notebooks\n",
    "\n",
    "If you've been following along and coding up the algorithms on your own, you might already have appreciated the cell-based approached to code and how flexible it is to recycle code without having to retype it, as you might with a REPL. Notebooks make it incredibly easy to revisit old code, package together certain functions/import statements, debug, and more. \n",
    "\n",
    "Notebooks also offer the great promise for sharing and learning more about anything, really! Any major conference with a programming focus (including PyData, Strata, PySpark, and more) always have tutorial talks, and an essential part of tutorials is the IPython/Jupyter notebook. Being able to follow what the teacher/speaker is doing on your own machine allows for a more hands-on approach to learning, and is very flexible if you want to modify or implement existing code. Jupyter Notebooks have a place industrially, personally, and even academically – including the reproducability of results through research or in-class assignments.\n",
    "\n",
    "Notebooks are a great way to share your ideas, projects, and results with others and modularize your code for incredible amounts of flexibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's some of the cool stuff you can do (besides easily present your work) with Jupyter Notebooks:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Kernels\n",
    "Jupyer supports numerous different kernels – including R, Julia, Ruby, and more – so you're not just limited to Python. Even within a notebook, you can run different types of code in different cells.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Magics\n",
    "The magic function system provides a series of functions which allow you to control the behavior of IPython itself, plus a lot of system-type features. The two kinds of magics are line-oriented and cell-oriented.\n",
    "\n",
    "Line magics are prefixed with the % character and work much like OS command-line calls: they get as an argument the rest of the line, where arguments are passed without parentheses or quotes.  For example, this will time the given statement:\n",
    "\n",
    "        %timeit range(1000)\n",
    "        \n",
    "Cell magics are prefixed with a double %%, and are functions that get not only the rest of the line, but also the lines below it in a separate argument. For example, this will time the execution of the numpy svd routine, running the assignment of x as part of the setup phase, which isn't timed:\n",
    "\n",
    "        %%timeit x = numpy.random.randn((100, 100))\n",
    "        numpy.linalg.svd(x)\n",
